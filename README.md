Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a pretty good place to start.
If you've got something specific in mind, then you can go find that, but if this just sort of a way to kill 5 minutes, then read on...

Once you've skimmed that, have a look at some of the projects I've got here, see if anything takes your fancy. 

I'm using the 'Susseratal' repository for a personal repository to keep hold of files and links that I want access to basically everywhere I go. However, for just general updates about me and what I'm doing, you can check out my website, youtube or twitter. (links at the bottom)  

Here's some basic information about me that might end up on my website at some point, if I can be bothered:  
Hardware:  
###########  
I custom built my PC:  
        PSU - RM750  
        Motherboard - Gigabyte B450M DS3H  
        CPU - AMD Ryzen 5 2600X @3.6 GHz  
        RAM - 16 Gigabytes DDR4 @3000 MHz  
        Graphics card - GeForce 1660 Super  
        Keyboard(s) - Drevo Tyrfing V2 with OUTEMU blue switches  
                    - Drevo Gramr with OUTEMU brown switches  
        Mouse - Logitech G402

But also have a mid 2012 era Macbook air, which I'm going to replace with something running linux (probably arch based on prior experience playing around) when it finally up and dies

Software:  
############  
Operating System (for coding)- Most often use MacOS seeing as it's Unix based and does everything I need, but I've had fun experimenting with different linux distros and am considering setting up a Linux partition on my desktop computer for programming.  
Terminal - Bash (Windows I use GitBash, or avoid using Windows)  
Text editor - Vi/Vim  
Browser - Opera  

On my PC, I do use windows because developing in Unreal engine is best in that and playing video games. As I say, I'd like to set up a secondary drive running Arch or something like that

Things I generally like:  
############  
Video games (Which I recommend):  
        Persona 5 - This has some of the best characters and story I have ever seen in a game, with an incredible soundtrack to boot  
        Dark Souls (1,2,3) and Bloodborne - A series of extremely challenging RPGs written and directed by the hugely talented Hidetaka Miyazaki  
        Thief II: The Metal Age - A stealth game from 2000. Although it's challenging, and the graphics have definitely aged, the solid story, characters and gameplay should carry this for most people  
        Deus Ex - A fantastic, cyberpunk dystopian RPG  
        Subnautica - One of the best survival games out there  

I listen to a lot of music while I do stuff (This music is some of the best):  
        The Sisters of Mercy  
        Metallica  
        Gary Neuman  
        Amanda Palmer/The Dresden Dolls  
        Cavetown  
        The Persona 5 OST (have you noticed a pattern yet?)  
        Radiohead  
        PJ Harvey  
        Powerwolf

Of course I like programming. I'm most familiar with python, although I am trying to learn the C languages as well as shell scripting, but I'm struggling to find the time. At the moment I'm mainly using Unreal Engine's visual scripting engine.
