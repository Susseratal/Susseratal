Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a pretty good place to start.
If you've got something specific in mind, then you can go find that, but if this just sort of a way to kill 5 minutes, then read on...

I'm using the 'Susseratal' repository for a personal repository to keep hold of files and links that I want access to basically everywhere I go. However, for just general updates about me and what I'm doing, you can check out my website, youtube or twitter. I write blog posts on my website periodically, I write long form transformative content about video games both on my website and on youtube, and my twitter is an absurdist nightmare.
