Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a good place to start. From here, I would recommend going to the about.txt in the Susseratal repo. I use it as a personal repository for information, todo lists etcetera

Once you've skimmed that, have a look at some of the projects I've got here, see if anything takes your fancy. 

Hope you like what I've done with the place

I've also now got a PDF of the complete works of HP Lovecraft. I would like to use this personal repository for "Stuff I'm into" and this seems a good enough place to start. This PDF was taken from 'https://arkhamarchivist.com/' So go show some love and appreciation to them!

Love, Iain
xoxo
