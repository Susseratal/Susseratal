Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a pretty good place to start.
If you've got something specific in mind, then you can go find that, but if this just sort of a way to kill 5 minutes, then read on...

This is just a personal repository which I'm using to kill two birds with one stone - I have a script on my computer which synchronises the contents of this folder with the versions present on my machine so I can easily keep it up to date.  
I won't be writing a script to install the other way, however, as that seems like a really good way of overwriting something important, so I incentivise that be done manually

For just general updates about me and what I'm doing, you can check out my website, youtube or twitter. My website is basically a portfolio, I write long form transformative content about video games on youtube, along with content about programming and whatever else crosses my path, and my twitter is an absurdist nightmare - abandon all hope, ye who enter there.
