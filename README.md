Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a good place to start. From here, I would recommend going to the about.txt

Once you've skimmed that, have a look at some of the projects I've got here, see if anything takes your fancy. 

Hope you like what I've done with the place

Love, Iain
xoxo
