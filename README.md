Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a good place to start.
If you've got something specific in mind, then you can go find that, but if this just sort of a way to kill 5 minutes, then read on...

From here, I would recommend going to the about.txt in the Susseratal repo. (pinned just under here) 
I use it as a personal repository for information, todo lists etcetera. However, if you've just come from my website, you're probably better off there.

Once you've skimmed that, have a look at some of the projects I've got here, see if anything takes your fancy. 

Hope you like what I've done with the place

I'm using the 'Susseratal' repository for a personal repository to keep hold of files and links that I want access to basically everywhere I go. I also want to use it as a bit of a repo for stuff I'm into because it's easier than creating a website. 

This didn't age very well now that I've started making a website. Whoops.

By the by, I'm working on updating the website and building it using Hugo, rather than Jekyll. This means I won't be hosting it on Github Pages anymore, but I prefer using Hugo to Jekyll. 
Obviously it's in a private repo and when it's in the same state as the github pages one, I'll delete, or more likely archive the github pages one. Maybe.

Love, Iain
xoxo
