Hello! If you're new here, and you've come from another of my numerous links, this is a good place to start. From here, I would recommend going to the about.txt in the Susseratal repo. I use it as a personal repository for information, todo lists etcetera

Once you've skimmed that, have a look at some of the projects I've got here, see if anything takes your fancy. 

Hope you like what I've done with the place

I'm using the 'Susseratal' repository for a personal repository to keep hold of files and links that I want access to basically everywhere I go. I also want to use it as a bit of a repo for stuff I'm into because it's easier than creating a website. I do wanna create a website though now. *adds it to the todo list*
I've also now got a PDF of the complete works of HP Lovecraft. This PDF was taken from 'https://arkhamarchivist.com/' So go show some love and appreciation to them!

Love, Iain
xoxo
