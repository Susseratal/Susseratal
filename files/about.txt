ALL ABOUT ME! YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED, BUT IT'S HERE

(This information is also available on the about page of my website)

        Motherboard - Gigabyte B450M DS3H
        CPU - AMD Ryzen 5 2600X @3.6 GHz 
        RAM - 16 Gigabytes DDR4 @3000 MHz
        Graphics card - GeForce 1660 Super
        Keyboard - Tyrfing V2 with OUTEMU blue switches
        Mouse - Basic bitch mouse

Software:
############
Terminal - Bash (Windows I use MINGW64)
Text editor - Vi/Vim

Secondary Browser - Opera
I will include copies of my bashrc and vimrc files if you're interested

Things I generally like:
############
Video games (Which I recommend):
        Persona 5 - This has some of the best characters and story I have ever seen in a game, with an incredible soundtrack to boot
        Dark Souls (1,2,3) and Bloodborne - A series of extremely challenging RPGs written and directed by the hugely talented Hidetaka Miyazaki
        Thief II: The Metal Age - A stealth game from 2000. Although it's challenging, and the graphics have definitely aged, the solid story, characters and gameplay should carry this for most people
        Deus Ex - A fantastic, cyberpunk dystopian RPG (I may append this list with Cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out)

I play the guitar sometimes

I do a lot of Programming (Which I intend to go on to do professionally in games design)

I listen to a lot of music while I do stuff (This music is some of the best):
        The Sisters of Mercy
        Metallica
        Gary Neuman
        Amanda Palmer/The Dresden Dolls
        Cavetown
        The Persona 5 OST (have you noticed a pattern yet?)
        Radiohead
        PJ Harvey
