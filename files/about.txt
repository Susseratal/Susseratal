ALL ABOUT ME! YOU MAY NOT BE INTERESTED, BUT IT'S HERE

###########
Sometimes I make videos about video games on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0iPDOFyP_TlPgiKEZT1i8g

I periodically say something stupid on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jtfjyrx

Hardware:
###########
I custom built my PC (Shelob):
        CPU - Intel core i5 3570k
        RAM - 8 Gigabytes of DDR3 RAM (soon to be 16 gig)
        Graphics card - GeForce 1660 Super
        Keyboard - Tyrfing V2 with OUTEMU blue switches

I also have a laptop (Andromeda):
        Macbook air

Software:
############
I use bash as my preferred terminal (On Shelob, I use MINGW64 so I can still use bash)
I use Vi/Vim as my preferred editor
I will include copies of my bashrc and vimrc files if you're interested

Things I generally like:
############
Video games (Which I recommend):
        Persona 5 - This has some of the best characters and story I have ever seen in a game, with an incredible soundtrack to boot
        Dark Souls (1,2,3) and Bloodborne - A series of extremely challenging RPGs written and directed by the hugely talented Hidetaka Miyazaki
        Thief II: The Metal Age - A stealth game from 2000. Although it's challenging, and the graphics have definitely aged, the solid story, characters and gameplay should carry this for most people
        Deus Ex - A fantastic, cyberpunk dystopian RPG (I may append this list with Cyberpunk 2077 when it comes out)

I play the guitar sometimes

I do a lot of Programming (Which I intend to go on to do professionally in games design)


I listen to a lot of music while I do stuff:
        The Sisters of Mercy
        Metallica
        Gary Neuman
        Amanda Palmer/The Dresden Dolls
        Cavetown
        The Persona 5 OST (have you noticed a pattern yet?)
        Radiohead
        PJ Harvey
