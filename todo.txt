IAIN'S TODO LIST FOR HIS VARIOUS THINGS

###############
General
###############
- [x] Get pip working with Shelob
- [ ] localise everything with "Pip Freeze"/docker file?
- [x] get getpass working on shelob (use cmd prompt not MINGW64(This ended up being easier than I expected))
- [x] create custom README for github profile
- [x] cry
- [x] Disk tidy up Laptop (I freed up a stonking great 20 gig, just in loose files!)
- [ ] Set up a bootable USB drive with Arch Linux/some other primarily text based operating system

###############
Frank
###############
- [ ] Create Frank in C#. I don't want to do this right now, but it'll happen at some point

###############
Star Wars Game
###############
- [x] Make Star Wars Game run through to save_config
- [ ] create turn based battle system in battle.py
        - [ ] The first move should do moderate damage and has a small range (such as 18-25)
        - [ ] The second move should have a large range of damage and can deal high or low damage (such as 10-35) ((Think critical hits in P5))
        - [ ] The third move should heal whoever casts it a moderate amount, similar to the first move (healing)
        - [ ] After each move, a message should be printed out that tells the user what just happened, and how much health the user and computer have 
        - [ ] Once the user or the computer's health reaches 0, the game should end
        - [ ] When someone is defeated, make sure the game prints out that their health has reached 0, and not a negative number
        - [ ] When the computer's health reaches a set amount (such as 35%), increase it's chance to cast heal (optional)
- [ ] Start adding story elements and battles

###############
Curses program
###############
- [ ] It won't run on windows because curses is Mac/Linux only
- [ ] Get it to do something more than just create an empty box that cannot be interacted with?
- [ ] Create a player avatar
- [ ] Make generated "Rooms" contain items like gold
- [ ] Create enemies
- [ ] Cry because everything is hard
